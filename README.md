# Kayaking at Loch Lomond — Live Demo
**Live Demo:** https://macdonald91.github.io/Kayaking-at-Loch-Lomond-Alasdair-MacDonald/

A simple, beginner-friendly webpage about my favourite pastime: **kayaking at Loch Lomond**.  
Being out on the water can feel peaceful and calm, with wide open views—but conditions can change at any moment and become challenging. That mix is exactly why I find kayaking so fun and rewarding. The page includes basic info, images, and simple tips, and mentions local activities like **Loch Lomond Leisure** for kayak hire and sessions.

This project was prototyped on **CodePen** and deployed with **GitHub Pages**.
